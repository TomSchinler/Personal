    <p class="resDesc">I have worked as a Personal Banker at Chase for more than 6 years now.  I was referred to the job by a former manager of mine.
       On a daily basis I am responsible for the maintenence of client accounts as well as sales of products and services.  Furthermore, I am responsible

    <img src="img/resBestBuy.png" alt="Best Buy Logo"/>
    <p class="resDesc">Working at Best Buy taught me the ins and outs of the retail world.  I experienced several aspects of the store, from front line sales to 
       supervisory management.  I was also part of the national roll out of Best Buy Mobile. This is where I first fell in love with the tech world.</p>
    
    <img src="img/resRjs.png" alt="RJ's Eatery Logo"/>
    <p class="resDesc">I worked for R.J.'s Eatery on and off for better than a decade.  Food Service was my first love, and to this day cooking is a passion of mine.
       It was at this small family owned restaurant that I truly discovered my desire to learn every aspect of my job, which led me to hold every position
       the company had, shy of General Manager.</p>
    
    <img id="phLogo" src="img/resPizzaHut.png" alt="Pizza Hut Logo"/>
    <p class="resDesc">When I started working at Pizza Hut the plan was to have something to bring in an income while I found a suitable career.  By the time I left the company, 
       in order to move back to Illinois, I was in a management position and had an open invitation to return.  During my tenure there, I was the 36th person in
       the Emerald City Pizza franchise history to be awarded their highest honor, the "Chain Link of Excellence".</p>

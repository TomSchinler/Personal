    <h1>Let me tell you a little about myself.</h1>
    <p class="aboutP">My interest in technology led me to pursue coursework to expand my knowledge and skill set.
       Utilizing the Team Treehouse school I learned to appreciate a mobile first approach with a 
       focus on responsive design. My preferred web development flavor is PHP.</p>

    <p class="aboutP">The most important aspects of my personal life are my wife of <?php echo $diff->y; ?> years and our 
       beautiful daughter, Tiana. I met Gina while serving in the 
       United States Navy.  My time in the Navy taught me a great deal and we work to instill those
       values in our daughter.</p>
    <p class="aboutP" id="aboutLast">Outside of the tech world, my interests include movies, cooking, and podcasts. My biggest 
       passion is pro wrestling. I share my love for this great sport with others through my website <a href="http://www.uhmgotzonwrestling.com">
       Uhmgotz on Wrestling</a>.
